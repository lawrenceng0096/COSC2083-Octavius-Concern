<h2>Team member informations</h2>
<p>Le Huy Hoang, student ID: s4026730, he is a personnel who likes to try out new things, he is always curious about how thing function and conducting studies about it to think about what can it benefits for him in future, what kind of experience can he gains from it and the way of him making a different product out by alternate those ideas to form up a different protocol to dealt with unsimilar categories. After studying for some months in School of Science, Engineering, Technology from RMIT, he realises that he still has a long way to go and he finds that there are many interesting things for him to discover during his study time here.</p>

<p>Nguyen Luong Le Bao, student ID: s3636073, currently studying in Bachelor of Language Major at RMIT Vietnam. He is an avid sci-fi and fantasy book reader and enjoys watching and playing various types of simulated and strategy games. Most of the reasons he got interested in IT actually had to do with curiosity about game developments and simulation technologies, such as the task of game programming, in-game AI developments, procedurally generated environments as well as various applications regarding simulations of environments and objects and how they can be applied to real-life scenarios.</p>

<p>Do Le Minh Quan, student ID: s4032589, he loves listening to music and playing video games. That led to his curiosity about technology starting when he was in secondary school. He loves deep-diving into how a computer’s components communicate with each other and create a useful working device. Soon enough, when he continued his study path in high school, he was inspired by his friends who had the same hobby about technology, so they began with small projects and basic coding. He is currently studying for an Information Technology Bachelor at RMIT with various languages, for instance, Java and web development languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

<p>Nguyen Viet Hoang Dan, student ID: s4053659, he likes to go to the gym, making humorous content whenever he has free time. He is interested in developing games, inspired by his experiences with games made by independent game developers, especially how they published such detailed games while needing more financial and workforce resources like big enterprises. He used to have a period of studying the Python programming language. Currently, he is learning and adapting C++ and C#, concentrating on the Artificial Intelligence and Software Development section.</p>

<p>Tram Anh Tuan, student ID is s4075376. He is currently studying at RMIT Vietnam as an information technology major. In his leisure time, he enjoys going to the gym and reading different book genres. Which helps him have an open mind about the world and improve and sustain his physical and mental health. He is also a part of the football club at RMIT. As playing many sports, he can communicate with other teammates easily on different topics. Since he can quickly get on with other teammates and understand each person's problems when working together, the team can cooperate more effectively to find solutions when handling the group project. Furthermore, a passion for exploring and fixing computer components and solving problems are the main reasons that keep him following the path of a Technical Engineer. Finally, he is currently self-studying Python and C++ to broaden his knowledge of programming languages and also upgrade his skills to work on his private project.</p>
<h1>Project Description:</h1>
<p>Providing a world where artists and graphic designers can work on their arts and share their products in the same environment zones. A place to connect people that share the same hobby in art.</p>

<h2> Aims: </h2>

<p>In order to achieve our aim, we divide it into three goals:</p>

<p>+ Mobility: The application can be accessed through the internet, they can access it anywhere they want while their data is being saved in the system and they still can continue their work even though they did not borrow their personal laptop or PC. And also to solve the problem where people have to do their art works on a separate application and then have to publish it in another platform which would naturally, errors is something to be expected and times.</p>

<p>+ Quality Education Site: Where everyone can receive education from experts within the majors through their experiences and knowledge within the field and we also want to provide them with a tutorial course which contains all the material including (written information and tutorial videos) we believe could help learners have a solid structure on becoming a promising artist and designer.</p>

<p>+ Development through users opinion: We will listen to our customers' feedback, judging which of those suggestions should be prioritised  for the improvement and elevating the platform into something better through times to satisfy the requirement of customers. We will conduct a routine check twice a month of our software in order to test out new accessibilities which could be used as a stepping stone for future projects.</p>

<p> In the worst case scenario when the project does not turn out the way we want, our group also planned to omit some of the more complicated parts of our website such as the marketplace and the community forum. Instead, the interface will be made more simplified and streamlined for faster loading and the HTML-5, Javascript and WebGL file sizes of the pages would be lighter to host online.These will also reduce error probability from heavy website assets. However, the core parts of our website such as the user accounts and registration database, the repository for user-made 3D asset files and the WebGL-based 3D interactive viewer to view these files are still essential for the purposes and goal of the project. For customers/users of the site wanting to communicate with us, the support centre page will still be retained, however it will be made of form-filling bars that will be sent directly to our emails whenever a customer types their questions out and clicks the “Send” button. 
</p>

<p> As for how we intent to gain money for our website in this kind of situation, because the website had free to download and upload 3D files, the site will instead rely on embedded advertisements and there will also be a donation page that listed the recipient Paypal accounts of the web-developers (us) to help continue hosting the page on the registered domain. These money will help us to address the feedback and reports of the customers of our page about potential errors and bugs related to accessing the website and its functions.
</p>

<h2> Plan & Progress: </h2>

<p> After 2 days discussion, we summarise all of them to convert them into an overview routine of how can we carry out the project; therefore we summarise it into 4 parts:</p>

<p> At the beginning we divide our groups into two different teams, one assigned with seeking and analysing materials related to the needs of areas that they found are still lacking or have never being existed before, others will design out the UX and UI sample or templates for the universal website structure the general views of how our software should look and it's mechanism when we are going to establish one.</p>

<p> Next, we call it “the first bricks”, this stage consists of conducting basic structure of our website based on the resources that we gathered to write down the basic structure of our land page, consisting of multiple action panels including home icon, sections, many more and a collapsible menu. During this period, we design the general page layout for our website so it is easy to understand from the user's perspective once they accessed the website, we place out every element in an order that we found that not only is spectacular but also to prevent unwanted accident interactions. For the head of our website, we place welcoming text and the action panels are below it for the head section; we fraticate 1 of them as a home icon, 4 consoles which contains the most searched categories in the website and a button to displaying all the tags for variety of assets, all of them (including home icon) representing the connection command with text on each of those buttons to express its purpose of performing something in the designed order. While the collapsible menu, we put it on the left side of the page, where we build it in the shape of a row rectangular, its length covered from under the home icon button to the rest of the page, its contains consoles that served for the purpose of a way to activate the command where it bring user to different sub pages within the platform. In order to not make those consoles look so simple, we made a modern style for each of them which recreates those common buttons into something more lively and it looks way smoother than when using their default form.</p>

<h2> Tools and technologies: </h2>

<p>Since this is a website application that displays 3D models, web programming languages make up the majority of the technologies required for this project. The language for document and content that can be used to show material and structure of web content is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Furthermore, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language for style sheets that is mostly used for extensive formatting in web design, much like the skin of HTML content. However, the backend is mostly in charge of handling the data on the homepage, such as 3D model files.</p> 

<p>Therefore Java must also be used on the backend to organize files, develop a search engine, and create a feature that allows users to filter items for better user experiences in order to handle the files that users can upload and see. Additionally, Polymage is utilized for both 2D and 3D presentations because this website differs from the majority of other websites. Thus, we want an advanced application called WebGL, a JavaScript API that can be used to render both 2D and 3D models. In addition to allowing users to examine models, WebGL also enables direct interaction with 3D models.</p>

<p>Figma Collaborative Interface Design Tool is another tool we used to create the mockup of our webpages, the reason for this is because we are developing a website with interactive elements and design so using this as our mockup would help us a lot in visualising the overall layout and functions. Because Figma also allows multiple people to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products, our group also uses it to help with the planning stage and visualise the progress of our project, as well as making contributions and feedback faster.</p>
<h2> Scope and limits: </h2>
<h2> Testing </h2>
<h2> Timeframe </h2>
<h2> Risks </h2>   
<h2> Group processes and communications </h2>
<h2> Skills and jobs</h2>
<h1> Group Reflections</h1>
<h2> Bảo's Reflection</h2>
<p> From my own perspective, as a whole, the group efforts are cooperative, and we often have meetings on a weekly basis for everyone to discuss and solve the problems we encountered in our project to the best of our abilities. Everyone fulfilled their part and helped each other out. Also while the project did not turn out the way we wanted, I’m very happy to see that my teammates are helpful at providing me advice and assistance on some of the more difficult parts that our project went through. 
Because our group set the goals for the project too high, the end result definitely fell short of what we intended as we lacked the skill set and experience that could suit with what the project need, nevertheless, the most helpful advice I can draw from this is that I should set my project goal next time to be more realistic and also suitable with my current skill set. 
One thing I find surprising about the project of our group is the complexity of web programming, aside the baseline HTML, there are also the more advanced CSS, JavaScript, HTML-5 and of course, WebGL which was required to run the 3D interactive viewer online for our intended website project. The file sizes of such a webpage would be quite heavy to run because of the graphics rendering as well as various functions to manipulate the 3D object and lighting in that viewer.
Lastly, through my experience with this group, I learned how crucial effective communication is for collaborative teamwork, and also how I should tone down my expectations in group work as everyone has their own skills and personality traits that have effect on the final results of the project, and to simply do my best in faces of the worst possible outcomes in it. </p>
