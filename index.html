<h2>Team member informations</h2>
<p>Le Huy Hoang, student ID: s4026730, he is a personnel who likes to try out new things, he is always curious about how thing function and conducting studies about it to think about what can it benefits for him in future, what kind of experience can he gains from it and the way of him making a different product out by alternate those ideas to form up a different protocol to dealt with unsimilar categories. After studying for some months in School of Science, Engineering, Technology from RMIT, he realises that he still has a long way to go and he finds that there are many interesting things for him to discover during his study time here.</p>

<p>Nguyen Luong Le Bao, student ID: s3636073, currently studying in Bachelor of Language Major at RMIT Vietnam. He is an avid sci-fi and fantasy book reader and enjoys watching and playing various types of simulated and strategy games. Most of the reasons he got interested in IT actually had to do with curiosity about game developments and simulation technologies, such as the task of game programming, in-game AI developments, procedurally generated environments as well as various applications regarding simulations of environments and objects and how they can be applied to real-life scenarios.</p>

<p>Do Le Minh Quan, student ID: s4032589, he loves listening to music and playing video games. That led to his curiosity about technology starting when he was in secondary school. He loves deep-diving into how a computerâ€™s components communicate with each other and create a useful working device. Soon enough, when he continued his study path in high school, he was inspired by his friends who had the same hobby about technology, so they began with small projects and basic coding. He is currently studying for an Information Technology Bachelor at RMIT with various languages, for instance, Java and web development languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

<p>Nguyen Viet Hoang Dan, student ID: s4053659, he likes to go to the gym, making humorous content whenever he has free time. He is interested in developing games, inspired by his experiences with games made by independent game developers, especially how they published such detailed games while needing more financial and workforce resources like big enterprises. He used to have a period of studying the Python programming language. Currently, he is learning and adapting C++ and C#, concentrating on the Artificial Intelligence and Software Development section.</p>

<p>Tram Anh Tuan, student ID is s4075376. He is currently studying at RMIT Vietnam as an information technology major. In his leisure time, he enjoys going to the gym and reading different book genres. Which helps him have an open mind about the world and improve and sustain his physical and mental health. He is also a part of the football club at RMIT. As playing many sports, he can communicate with other teammates easily on different topics. Since he can quickly get on with other teammates and understand each person's problems when working together, the team can cooperate more effectively to find solutions when handling the group project. Furthermore, a passion for exploring and fixing computer components and solving problems are the main reasons that keep him following the path of a Technical Engineer. Finally, he is currently self-studying Python and C++ to broaden his knowledge of programming languages and also upgrade his skills to work on his private project.</p>
<h1>Project Description:</h1>
<p>Providing a world where artists and graphic designers can work on their arts and share their products in the same environment zones. A place to connect people that share the same hobby in art.</p>

<p>In order to achieve our aim, we divide it into three goals:</p>

<p>+ Mobility: The application can be accessed through the internet, they can access it anywhere they want while their data is being saved in the system and they still can continue their work even though they did not borrow their personal laptop or PC. And also to solve the problem where people have to do their art works on a separate application and then have to publish it in another platform which would naturally, errors is something to be expected and times.</p>

<p>+ Quality Education Site: Where everyone can receive education from experts within the majors through their experiences and knowledge within the field and we also want to provide them with a tutorial course which contains all the material including (written information and tutorial videos) we believe could help learners have a solid structure on becoming a promising artist and designer.</p>

<p>+ Development through users opinion: We will listen to our customers' feedback, judging which of those suggestions should be prioritised  for the improvement and elevating the platform into something better through times to satisfy the requirement of customers. We will conduct a routine check twice a month of our software in order to test out new accessibilities which could be used as a stepping stone for future projects.</p>

<h3> Tools and technologies</h3>

<p>Since this is a website application that displays 3D models, web programming languages make up the majority of the technologies required for this project. The language for document and content that can be used to show material and structure of web content is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Furthermore, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language for style sheets that is mostly used for extensive formatting in web design, much like the skin of HTML content. However, the backend is mostly in charge of handling the data on the homepage, such as 3D model files.  Therefore Java must also be used on the backend to organize files, develop a search engine, and create a feature that allows users to filter items for better user experiences in order to handle the files that users can upload and see. Additionally, Polymage is utilized for both 2D and 3D presentations because this website differs from the majority of other websites. Thus, we want an advanced application called WebGL, a JavaScript API that can be used to render both 2D and 3D models. In addition to allowing users to examine models, WebGL also enables direct interaction with 3D models.</p>
