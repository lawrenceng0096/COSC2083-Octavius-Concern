<h2> Member information: </h2>

<p> Le Huy Hoang, student ID: s4026730, he is experiencing his first semester of Bachelor of Information Technology in RMIT Vietnam, South Saigon Campus. He is a personnel who likes to try out new things, he is always curious about how thing function and conducting studies about it to think about what can it benefits for him in future, what kind of experience can he gains from it and the way of him making a different product out by alternate those ideas to form up a different protocol to dealt with unsimilar categories. After studying for a few months in the School of Science, Engineering, Technology from RMIT, he realises that he still has a long way to go and he finds that there are many interesting things for him to discover during his study time here. Furthermore, he has more hobbies and overcomes shyness than in the past; now he likes to do group outside activities more after entering the school. His wish is to become an IT specialist in Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare. </p>

<p> Nguyen Luong Le Bao, student ID: s3636073, is a 3rd year Bachelor of Language Major student at RMIT Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City. He is a sci-fi and fantasy book reader and enjoys watching similar movies and TV series as well as playing various types of simulated and strategy games. Most of the reasons he got interested in IT actually had to do with his interests in game developments, game designs and simulation technologies. For example the stages of game programming, in-game AI developments, procedurally generated environments as well as various applications regarding simulations of environments and objects and how they can be applied to real-life scenarios. He is currently practising web designs and web programming with CSS, Javascript and HTML5 and 3D modelling and animation as his pastimes hobbies as well to share the stuff of his creative concepts. He is probably gonna pursue future careers in the game design and development field or in animation that is related to VR technologies and the applications of AI in simulations and video games. </p>

<p> Do Le Minh Quan, student ID: s4032589, during his free time he usually spends time listening to music and playing video games for entertainment. His passion for technology started when he was in secondary school, which he loves deep-diving into how a computer’s components communicate with each other and create a useful working device. His program developer passion started when he entered high school where he was introduced to Python by his classmate and tried to do some simple projects.  He is currently studying for an Information Technology Bachelor at RMIT with various languages mostly focused on web programming, for instance, Java was used for API or website backend where manage files or features. Furthermore, for website frontend he started to learn web languages like HTML, CSS. Although he still lacks a lot of knowledge about coding so currently, he tries to learn basic HTML and CSS for web design and most importantly is Java with an extensive concept for API like JDBC which is a connection between java and database from SQl or Javalin. </p>

<p> Nguyen Viet Hoang Dan, student ID: s4053659, he likes to go to the gym, making humorous content whenever he has free time. He is interested in developing games, inspired by his experiences with games made by independent game developers, especially how they published such detailed games while needing more financial and workforce resources like big enterprises. He used to have a period of studying the Python programming language. Currently, he is learning and adapting HTML, C++ and C#, concentrating on the Artificial Intelligence and Software Development section. </p>

<p> Tram Anh Tuan, student ID is s4075376. He is currently studying at RMIT Vietnam as an information technology major. In his leisure time, he enjoys going to the gym and reading different book genres. Which helps him have an open mind about the world and improve and sustain his physical and mental health. He is also a part of the football club at RMIT. As playing many sports, he can communicate with other teammates easily on different topics. Since he can quickly get on with other teammates and understand each person's problems when working together, the team can cooperate more effectively to find solutions when handling the group project. Furthermore, a passion for exploring and fixing computer components and solving problems are the main reasons that keep him following the path of a Technical Engineer. Finally, he is currently self-studying Python and C++ to broaden his knowledge of programming languages and also upgrade his skills to work on his private project. </p>

<p> VScode: This is the main IDE for HTML and CSS coding in order to write a website sample.
So far, the goal of our project first was to develop a website with this kind of layout in mind, either using CSS or JavaScript. However there are many challenges, trials and errors we experienced along the way.</p>

<p> Wix: Wix is a US-publicly listed cloud-based web development service and platform from Israel that offers tools for creating HTML5 websites and mobile sites using online drag-and-drop editing. This is the tool the group initially used to assist in the website development as our knowledge regarding web programming is still being limited. The reason why we choose Wix is because it is a free service that offers and assists its clients in making professional, free websites, while also offering more advanced features such as markets, booking services and domain hosting as the extra paid user plans for clients. Wix platform itself is primarily HTML5 and Javascript based and allows users to develop websites that don’t require much knowledge about web programming. Initially our group was using this as the main website development tool but due to some errors during the testing stage, the idea of using Wix was abandoned.</p>

<p> W3Shools Spaces: W3Schools Spaces is a website that offers users to build and experiment with web-programming, and even offer website hosting. In W3SChools Spaces, they offer people to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript editors and even hosting images and audio files to the websites. Our group is using this as the main tool to write the simple HTML website for our report that will also be hosted on the group Github repository.</p>

<h1> Project Description: </h1>


<h2> Aims: </h2>

<p>Providing a world where artists and graphic designers can work on their arts and share their products in the same environment zones. A place to connect people that share the same hobby in art. </p>

<p> In order to achieve our aim, we divide it into three crucial goals: </p>

<p>+ Mobility: The application can be accessed through the internet, they can access it anywhere they want while their data is being saved in the system and they still can continue their work even though they did not borrow their personal laptop or PC. And also to solve the problem where people have to do their art works on a separate application and then have to publish it in another platform which would naturally, errors is something to be expected and times.</p>

<p>+ Quality Education Site: Where everyone can receive education from experts within the majors through their experiences and knowledge within the field and we also want to provide them with a tutorial course which contains all the material including (written information and tutorial videos) we believe could help learners have a solid structure on becoming a promising artist and designer.</p>

<p>+ Development through users opinion: We will listen to our customers' feedback, judging which of those suggestions should be prioritised  for the improvement and elevating the platform into something better through times to satisfy the requirement of customers. We will conduct a routine check twice a month of our software in order to test out new accessibilities which could be used as a stepping stone for future projects.</p>

<p> In the worst case scenario when the project does not turn out the way we want, our group also planned to omit some of the more complicated parts of our website such as the marketplace and the community forum. Instead, the interface will be made more simplified and streamlined for faster loading and the HTML-5, Javascript and WebGL file sizes of the pages would be lighter to host online.These will also reduce error probability from heavy website assets. However, the core parts of our website such as the user accounts and registration database, the repository for user-made 3D asset files and the WebGL-based 3D interactive viewer to view these files are still essential for the purposes and goal of the project. For customers/users of the site wanting to communicate with us, the support centre page will still be retained, however it will be made of form-filling bars that will be sent directly to our emails whenever a customer types their questions out and clicks the “Send” button. 
</p>

<p> As for how we intent to gain money for our website in this kind of situation, because the website had free to download and upload 3D files, the site will instead rely on embedded advertisements and there will also be a donation page that listed the recipient Paypal accounts of the web-developers (us) to help continue hosting the page on the registered domain. These money will help us to address the feedback and reports of the customers of our page about potential errors and bugs related to accessing the website and its functions.
</p>

<h2> Plan & Progress: </h2>

<h3> Plan: </h3>

<p> After 2 days discussion, we summarise all of the ideas together and we convert them into an overview routine of how can we carry out the project; therefore we summarise it into 4 parts: </p>

<p> At the beginning we divide our groups into two different teams, one assigned with seeking and analysing materials related to the needs of areas that they found are still lacking or have never being existed before, others will design out the UX and UI sample or templates for the universal website structure the general views of how our software should look and it's mechanism when we are going to establish one. </p>

<p> Next, we call it “the first bricks”, this stage consists of conducting basic structure of our website based on the resources that we gathered to write down the basic structure of our land page, consisting of multiple action panels including home icon, sections, many more and a collapsible menu. During this period, we design the general page layout for our website so it is easy to understand from the user's perspective once they accessed the website, we place out every element in an order that we found that not only is spectacular but also to prevent unwanted accident interactions. For the head of our website, we place welcoming text and the action panels are below it for the head section; we fraticate 1 of them as a home icon, 4 consoles which contains the most searched categories in the website and a button to displaying all the tags for variety of assets, all of them (including home icon) representing the connection command with text on each of those buttons to express its purpose of performing something in the designed order. While the collapsible menu, we put it on the left side of the page, where we build it in the shape of a row rectangular, its length covered from under the home icon button to the rest of the page, its contains consoles that served for the purpose of a way to activate the command where it bring user to different sub pages within the platform. In order to not make those consoles look so simple, we made a modern style for each of them which recreates those common buttons into something more lively and it looks way smoother than when using their default form.</p>

<p> Then, going deeper, after we completed the general concepts for our main page of the website, we focused on how to customise and construct our sub pages in our application; each of them are assigned with different purposes. There are 5 of them in total, named as Design & Analytics Studio, Marketing & Trading, Events, Forum, Support. For the Design & Analytics Studio page, users will have a default toolbar for editing and modelling their product making by our developers, it including  an option button to choose a variety of tools that existed in others designing applications before, another one is to upload or export their files and continue work on it, while it being saved there automatically overtime and become a draft, which mean there is no need to worry about have to clicking save button for times and also to prevent any data loss due to unexpected incidents that could waste all of their efforts and also they can extract that file anywhere just by log in their account and go to the page. Furthermore, we have an AI chatbot terminal where it can give out sample templates or give suggestions when people ask them on the way of creating a new model, based on their text or their example models. Moving on to the Marketing & Trading page, in here every product will displayed and they can be inspected by anyone, also there will be a filter button to show out every context tags and a search bar within this page, this is to return the result quicker and easier for the customers to find out notable material they looking for, we also allow a temporary chat that allows selected individuals to exchange information about the agreement and adjust it until they pleased with the conditions. The Events page, where we or company host out every activities for both competition or for the recruitment progress, it will be displayed in the centre of the page, it will be representative as a column with name, by entering one of them, it will gives out every details about the activity that was being selected by them. Event hosts can adjust the difficulty level of their tasks and the reward, in order to ensure that there is no fraud or any complaints about the dishonesty of the event administration team, clients will have to ask or send us a notification about their plans on conducting the events, after some discussion, we will clarifying whether the plan would be approved or not, after it got accepted, we will send to the client a support team in order they need help in something related to our application and also to do the administration team, for instance when a person violated the Code of Conduct in our website, there will be punishment given to them by the admin. Forum is where everyone can discuss with each other about a topic created by anyone, every member is allowed to express their perspective, but they need to make sure that it does not cross  the line. In this page, there will be 2 action panels, one for creating a thread where people place their statements about the topic they want to discuss with others users can upload images in here too, in order to present their ideas more directly. Last but not least, the Support page, as its name mentioned the real purpose of the page, is where people can ask questions, send their feedback or any other issues regarding our application; depending on the statements, we will solve the problems that our users are having or support them as soon as we can. This is where we can gather users' experiences in our application by tracking their activities including their advice on how we can improve them. </p>

<p> Finally, we will work on how to connect those together without causing a bug within the system when it is operating and conduct testing full scale on our application to make sure that we did not miss some elements in our website, change a little bit of our website design if it is necessary and test out every accessibilities. Therefore, we will run every scenario to find out whether there is an error in our platform function when we run them before deploying our product. </p>

<h3> Progress: </h3>

<p> During the discussion and designation phase, we have a little bit of struggle in finding an interesting topic that we can work on with our current skills set. It is until Bao gives his opinion about using some elements from our group's previous idea and based on it to create an improved alternative product, we then agree to follow his advice after some more discussion about whether it could fit and what it could bring to or help people in the field. </p>

<p> On one hand, we found that we did well in gathering resources and in designing UX and UI samples for our platform, the progress has gone quite smoothly to be fair, we did have a bit of issues but our team members did lend a hand whenever someone need assistance on doing their tasks or giving their suggestions in things. Despite the fact that it took us almost a week, we believe that the time we have to spend is worth all of our efforts and time, because not only we find all the necessary data, we also gain more knowledge that would benefit us later on the developing protocol. </p>

<p> On the other hand, we found that we still lack experience in utilising those information, commands and structures of programming languages used for coding our product which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is because most of us have not taken web programming courses yet or have not learned much about them despite having received some basic instruction from our lecturer recently, that is not enough for us to be too creative in applying them and likely to use pretty much references to solving our confusion or issues. </p>

<p> As for our developing stages, we are struggling on using third parties to create our platform, Wix because of the complicated mechanism of their tools, function and limitations, we then have to redevelop it with VS Code, W3Schools and Figma tool. We still manage to complete the landing page of our platform and are still working on sub pages. The reason is that when we try to convert it into HTML and then check it through VS Code, we find that the assets are misplaced, even after configuring it for 3 days, the outcome does not come like what we expected. Therefore, after 3 days of hard work but not really overcoming obstacles, we approached it in a new way; which was redeveloping our program with VS Code, W3Schools and Figma. On the contrary, although the redevelopment will also mean that the time to finish the project will be extended, we are still satisfied when we use other programming platforms, there are less limitations and restrictions when coding there, which also means we can customise the website to be more spectacular in the eyes of users and there will number of interaction increased which will attract many other people and somewhat clients. Therefore, helping us a lot in dealing with the profit and fees problem in the maintenance and management stage. </p>

<p> Overall, the plan of developing a functional website did eventually come to some promising results. We did have a functional website. This includes a functional and collapsible menu, several subpages, and a proper search function. The idea of a 3D viewer however was a bit difficult to tackle so we actually have to come up with the approach of using a pre-made WebGL-based 3D viewer as the template. However, because we also don't have enough time, we have only tested the pre-made 3D viewer on Github before we incorporate it to our website. The 3D viewer did work, although it wasn't as good at rendering multiple materials as we would have wanted. So far, visualising through the Figma interactive design and programming a mockup VS Code website are the most optimal ways we have achieved in realising parts of our vision. </p>

<h2> Roles: </h2>

<p> For the roles of each members in our project, they are all allocated as follow: </p>

<p> Leader: This role was actually helmed by Nguyen Luong Le Bao. The leadership roles would involve overseeing the daily activities of the group to ensure the progress of the project goes according to plan. Also the leader would need to facilitate communication between members of the team and allocate appropriate time and resources for them to perform their roles. Lastly the leader ensured that the conflicts and clashes between team members are solved so that it won't interfere with the outcome of the project. </p>

<p> Web programmer: This role was handled by Le Do Minh Quan and Le Huy Hoang whose main role is to design, program and code the page and subpages of our website project. In this role, they also have knowledge in web design with CSS, HTML and Javascript and they would have to work with the leaders and editors to check and see if the final outcome of the project met its intended requirements in the plan. </p>

<p> Editors: This role is handled by Nguyen Luong Le Bao and Le Huy Hoang, they are in charge of checking the group report document and project file contents related to the mockup websites and group report pages to see if it match with the appropriate format when it comes to academic report and the proper IEEE references and citations. The editors also check for other mistakes such as grammar and unnatural vocabulary to make sure the quality of the report text is up to English standards. </p>

<p> Researchers: This role is handled by Le Do Minh Quan, Nguyen Viet Hoang Dan and Tram Anh Tuan, they have the responsibility to collect second-hand resources on the internet related to the materials of our project. These are for analysing and summarising the needs of the clients, the market demands and the industry sectors, as well as the possible risks associated with these websites when it comes to topics such as copyrights infringements or potential cybersecurity risks. </p>

<h2> Tools and technologies: </h2>

<p> Since this is a website application that displays 3D models, web programming languages make up the majority of the technologies required for this project. The language for document and content that can be used to show material and structure of web content is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Furthermore, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language for style sheets that is mostly used for extensive formatting in web design, much like the skin of HTML content. However, the backend is mostly in charge of handling the data on the homepage, such as 3D model files.</p> 

<p> Therefore Java must also be used on the backend to organize files, develop a search engine, and create a feature that allows users to filter items for better user experiences in order to handle the files that users can upload and see. Additionally, Polymage is utilized for both 2D and 3D presentations because this website differs from the majority of other websites. Thus, we want an advanced application called WebGL, a JavaScript API that can be used to render both 2D and 3D models. In addition to allowing users to examine models, WebGL also enables direct interaction with 3D models.</p>

<p> Figma Collaborative Interface Design Tool is another tool we used to create the mockup of our webpages, the reason for this is because we are developing a website with interactive elements and design so using this as our mockup would help us a lot in visualising the overall layout and functions. Because Figma also allows multiple people to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products, our group also uses it to help with the planning stage and visualise the progress of our project, as well as making contributions and feedback faster.</p>

<h2>Scope and limits:</h2>

<p> The goal of our project is to develop a novel website concept that has the potential to advance 3D models or in the future will be virtual reality  more broadly. For this reason, our website offers an environment for users who are passionate about 3D model rendering, allowing them to share their creations with a community that is encouraging. Additionally, this website functions as a marketplace for 3D designers, providing them with a means of making a little money to support their pastime and foster the development of a passionate community. However, completing this project needed extensive understanding of website creation, and as we are still in the early stages of our studies, this website has several restrictions. The idea of online interactive 3D models requires specialized tools, additional WebGL implementation knowledge, and proficiency with Java in order to manage the user file database. </p>

<h2> Testing: </h2>

<p> We all agreed to build the project using Wix Studio due to this website being user-friendly so it is easier for us to approach and modify. Moreover, due to the shortness of time, Wix Studio is the best website that can illustrate our team demo the most efficiently.  However, we encountered a problem in the middle of using Wix. The codes did not turn out as good as we wanted and it was too complicated to program it manually. We also used the Figma website to convert our project mockup, but we got stuck when converting the files into websites. It created a very disorganised code and the page occurred with disarranged elements. In the end, after researching the problems and cooperating, we were able to find the solutions to fix the problem.  After completing our project, we intend to use Kalaton to test our website. If the website passes successfully fully, we will publish it and develop more features to suit the demand of users. We chose Kalaton because it is flexible in tools that we can record the procedure when testing if bugs occur, we can easily notice and fix them. Regarding using Kalaton, we intend to test the website with Regression Testing so that the test is carried out at all levels. Furthermore, we also considered if we have to test the regression testing implemented on common software or various products.  Nevertheless, we encountered some defects in the website about the marketplace, so the testing units for the website did not fully pass.  </p>

<h2> Risks: </h2>

<p> 1. Learning Curve: If our project involves using new software or technology, there's a risk that it may have a steeper learning curve than anticipated. </p>

<p> 2. Tool Limitations: The chosen software or hardware may not have all the features or capabilities promised, leading to potential setbacks. </p>

<p> 3. Glitches/Bugs: Unexpected technical issues or bugs might arise during development, causing delays. </p>

<p> 4. Resource Constraints: Insufficient access to required resources, such as software licences or hardware components, could hinder progress. </p>

<p> 5. Dependency on External Factors: If our project relies on external APIs, libraries, or services, there's a risk of changes in those external factors affecting your project. </p>

<p> 6. Team Collaboration Issues: Conflicts or communication breakdowns within the team could impact productivity. </p>

<p> 7. Cyberattack: Unwanted assaults could cause major setbacks. </p>

<h2> Group processes and communications: </h2>

<p> Throughout the project, our team often tried various methods of communication in order to maintain coordinations and effective management of each member's duties and their given tasks. The most common way we often communicate is through Facebook Messenger, usually by the group chat room where one can receive any latest messages from other team members about latest changes and developments in our project progress. This is done on a daily basis, however we also have problems with unresponsive members in the chat room who are too slow in doing their tasks and are not even actively engaging in group chat. In this case we did try the method of calling their names out and reminding them of what they got to do, however it was only marginally effective and has actually delayed some parts of our project because of the lack of coordinations in these members. </p>

<p> The second method is arguably more effective, we also have weekly face-to-face meetings on the weekends at some local cafe near RMIT to summarise and analyse what we have completed throughout the projects, as well as holding discussion to give suggestions, advices on what need to be edited and improved throughout the various phases of the projects. Other than that we also use group video calls/phone calls to meet on the weekends to actually do the similar things as our face-to-face meetings in case we can not all go to the cafe. These methods ensure that most of the members of the team will be available and can work on the project and coordinate more effectively with one another directly without hampering most of the project phases. </p>

<p> In summary, there are some problems with time management in our team, however, we still believe that we have tried our best in managing and coordinating with such a large team in this project. We all have tried our hardest to accomplish our tasks even if it was delayed significantly. Our group's hardest experience from this however is the fact that we have to manage and plan our phases in a more timely manner so that it will not affect the eventual outcomes of any future projects we come across. </p>

<h2> Skills and jobs: </h2>

<p> As a group, we also consider the idea of what our team would be like if it was in a more professional environment. To this, we first consider what fields the project we are working on belong to when it comes to IT, and next we select the appropriate positions and roles that can be appointed to each person in the team. The web programming and game development would be the two industry sectors that matched the best with our project plan in this case. </p>

<p> Firstly, the leader of the team is also the project manager who oversees and coordinates the members of the team and regularly checks on their progress to ensure the project goes smoothly as well as solving any possible conflicts and arguments that happened throughout the development phase. The leader also needs to set out realistic and concrete goals for the project as well as assist and guide their team members throughout their works and has the responsibility of maintaining the morale of the group as well. </p>

<p> Secondly, we have the graphic designer who will come up with the planning stage for the project, what needs to be done and also sketching up the preliminary visions and concepts for the project based on the given requirements and demands set by the clients. The graphic designer in this case also planned the overall layout of the webpage alongside its subpages, and which assets that are gonna be needed to be included on the site to make it function properly. Therefore, creativity skills such as understanding user interface, interactive designs and languages are needed. The graphic designers would also be the ones to make adjustments based on feedback from the programmers and project manager to ensure the graphics and layouts are appealing and suitable with the client requirements. </p>

<p> Third, we have the web programmer who has the task of implementing the plans and the concepts of the project manager and graphic designer into reality. This is the person who is also in charge of backend developments, user testing and debugging whichever errors or bugs that occurred throughout the website testing phase before it goes public. The web programmer also has the task of maintaining and creating servers to house all the relevant data and documents related to the project, as well as improving and expanding these servers as the website and its user database would grow much bigger in the future. For this case, an experienced web programmer well versed in the use of HTML, CSS, WebGL and JavaScript-based technologies are most preferable. </p>

<p> Lastly, we have two people in both data researcher and analyst roles. Their tasks are to collect relevant data from either first hand or second hand resources, such as market trends, consumer demands, etc et. The researcher also has the task of the analyst in analysing, identifying and lastly summarising the relevant information and documents related to the requirement of the projects to other team members to ensure the project met the objectives. Lastly, the researcher also has to match the requirements of the clients with the given budgets to see on whether the team project capability and its predicted outcome can be done, if not then they are also the ones to give out advices regarding the project fundings and various other readjustment policies to match with the more realistic expectations of the final product that the project is expected to make. In the role of both researcher and analyst, the skillset required are critical thinking to analyse data, problem-solving to give out best possible advices and suggestions for unwanted issues related to project progress and lastly, time management as the task of the researcher will be limited by the time constraint of the project deadline. </p>

<h1> Group Reflections: </h1>

<h2> Bảo's Reflection: </h2>

<p> From my own perspective, as a whole, the group efforts are cooperative, and we often have meetings on a weekly basis for everyone to discuss and solve the problems we encountered in our project to the best of our abilities. Everyone fulfilled their part and helped each other out. Also while the project did not turn out the way we wanted, I'm very happy to see that my teammates are helpful at providing me advice and assistance on some of the more difficult parts that our project went through. 
Because our group set the goals for the project too high, the end result definitely fell short of what we intended as we lacked the skill set and experience that could suit with what the project need, nevertheless, the most helpful advice I can draw from this is that I should set my project goal next time to be more realistic and also suitable with my current skill set. 
One thing I find surprising about the project of our group is the complexity of web programming, aside the baseline HTML, there are also the more advanced CSS, JavaScript, HTML-5 and of course, WebGL which was required to run the 3D interactive viewer online for our intended website project. The file sizes of such a webpage would be quite heavy to run because of the graphics rendering as well as various functions to manipulate the 3D object and lighting in that viewer.
Lastly, through my experience with this group, I learned how crucial effective communication is for collaborative teamwork, and also how I should tone down my expectations in group work as everyone has their own skills and personality traits that have effect on the final results of the project, and to simply do my best in faces of the worst possible outcomes in it. </p>

<h2> Quan's reflection: </h2>

<p> From my experience, as the past nearly 2 months approached, everyone as a group was very supportive and showed their commitment during the project. We often gather once or twice a weekend to exchange thoughts on our project ideas and to collaborate together to solve challenges to get the best possible outcome. Our team's original and incredible inventive ideas for the 3D model were generated throughout the project ideation phase. Furthermore, finding someone who shared my interest in modelling and game development in general was also really exciting. The fact that our group's project is a website allowed me to actively learn some web programming, which improved my ability to work with others in a team and see the value of cooperation. However, it was challenging to complete this project as planned because I still lack a lot of expertise and skills in programming. As a result, there are still certain areas that require improvement, most important among them being the WebGL concept, about which I know very little about practical applications. In summary, I would say that working in a team that is encouraging and where everyone is trying their hardest to contribute to the project as much as they can is exciting for me overall. </p>

<h2> Dan's reflection: </h2>

<p> From what I have seen, our group has been working together and communicating a lot through third party group chat to help each other at their assigned work. Every weekend we have face-to-face meetings for better communications and discussions for our work. I think we did try our best at fulfilling our responsibilities despite personal businesses and other subjects' work. However, setbacks such as other assignments in other subjects and some inexperienced parts such as coding make our results not seem like how we would vision, in which I should improve arranging the time for work. Although, I have discovered more HTML and CSS language for our projects which is interesting and helpful in future projects and careers and other members have lots of potential through different stuff they have done in different assignments. In summary, my motivations lie in being part of a team where everyone is not only encouraging but also discovering new knowledge and abilities while doing the project. </p>

<h2> Hoang's reflection: </h2>

<p> I strongly believe that although most of us are still lacking programming knowledge and experiences due to not taking the web programming courses yet, we still manage to do quite a good job in doing this assignment although we did submit the file later than 2 days after the due date. The good point is that I found our team is friendly and ready to share hard times together, helping every member when undertaking the project and I appreciate this period because I know more about how to work as a whole and gained more experiences on doing group tasks further. I do not regret being a member in this team, everyone tried their best to finish their mission as soon as they could despite being busy in other courses running at the same time as well and I appreciate that. Overall, It is believed that our group is well functioning, the only thing left needed to be added here is experiences. </p>

<h2> Tuan's Reflection: </h2>

<p> From my point of view, every team member is very supportive and hardworking in completing the responsibility of their roles in the project. Each member always sets aside time for group meetings at the weekends to discuss and plan for our group work and help each other overcome the problems in the assignment regardless of each person’s work and the workload of other modules. Regarding the problems with our team, there are two things that we could improve. Firstly, we should set the priority and outline the deadline reminder for each part of the project so that all members can gather to help find the solutions for the problems to handle the issues in time less likely to overlap and lead to the last option to hand in the assignment past the time of the deadline. Secondly, every member should give constructive and detailed feedback on other teammates’s work in order for each individual to reflect on their work so that they can be more productive and understand which parts can be improved. The things that I was amazed by when working in the group were the teamwork skills I gained after completing the project, such as time management, setting personal goals, prioritising skills, effective communication, etc. I acknowledge that there are many skills that I still lack, and I will continue to practice being more comprehensive towards the group assignments in the future. </p>
