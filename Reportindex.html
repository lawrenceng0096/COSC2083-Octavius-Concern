<h2>Team member informations</h2>
<p> Le Huy Hoang, student ID: s4026730, he is experiencing his first semester of Bachelor of Information Technology in RMIT Vietnam, South Saigon Campus. He is a personnel who likes to try out new things, he is always curious about how thing function and conducting studies about it to think about what can it benefits for him in future, what kind of experience can he gains from it and the way of him making a different product out by alternate those ideas to form up a different protocol to dealt with unsimilar categories. After studying for a few months in the School of Science, Engineering, Technology from RMIT, he realises that he still has a long way to go and he finds that there are many interesting things for him to discover during his study time here. Furthermore, he has more hobbies and overcomes shyness than in the past; now he likes to do group outside activities more after entering the school. </p>

<p>Nguyen Luong Le Bao, student ID: s3636073, currently studying in Bachelor of Language Major at RMIT Vietnam. He is an avid sci-fi and fantasy book reader and enjoys watching and playing various types of simulated and strategy games. Most of the reasons he got interested in IT actually had to do with curiosity about game developments and simulation technologies, such as the task of game programming, in-game AI developments, procedurally generated environments as well as various applications regarding simulations of environments and objects and how they can be applied to real-life scenarios.</p>

<p>Do Le Minh Quan, student ID: s4032589, he loves listening to music and playing video games. That led to his curiosity about technology starting when he was in secondary school. He loves deep-diving into how a computer’s components communicate with each other and create a useful working device. Soon enough, when he continued his study path in high school, he was inspired by his friends who had the same hobby about technology, so they began with small projects and basic coding. He is currently studying for an Information Technology Bachelor at RMIT with various languages, for instance, Java and web development languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

<p>Nguyen Viet Hoang Dan, student ID: s4053659, he likes to go to the gym, making humorous content whenever he has free time. He is interested in developing games, inspired by his experiences with games made by independent game developers, especially how they published such detailed games while needing more financial and workforce resources like big enterprises. He used to have a period of studying the Python programming language. Currently, he is learning and adapting C++ and C#, concentrating on the Artificial Intelligence and Software Development section.</p>

<p>Tram Anh Tuan, student ID is s4075376. He is currently studying at RMIT Vietnam as an information technology major. In his leisure time, he enjoys going to the gym and reading different book genres. Which helps him have an open mind about the world and improve and sustain his physical and mental health. He is also a part of the football club at RMIT. As playing many sports, he can communicate with other teammates easily on different topics. Since he can quickly get on with other teammates and understand each person's problems when working together, the team can cooperate more effectively to find solutions when handling the group project. Furthermore, a passion for exploring and fixing computer components and solving problems are the main reasons that keep him following the path of a Technical Engineer. Finally, he is currently self-studying Python and C++ to broaden his knowledge of programming languages and also upgrade his skills to work on his private project.</p>

<p>VScode: This is the main IDE for HTML and CSS coding in order to write a website sample.
So far, the goal of our project first was to develop a website with this kind of layout in mind, either using CSS or JavaScript. However there are many challenges, trials and errors we experienced along the way.</p>

<p>Wix: Wix is a US-publicly listed cloud-based web development service and platform from Israel that offers tools for creating HTML5 websites and mobile sites using online drag-and-drop editing. This is the tool the group initially used to assist in the website development as our knowledge regarding web programming is still being limited. The reason why we choose Wix is because it is a free service that offers and assists its clients in making professional, free websites, while also offering more advanced features such as markets, booking services and domain hosting as the extra paid user plans for clients. Wix platform itself is primarily HTML5 and Javascript based and allows users to develop websites that don’t require much knowledge about web programming. Initially our group was using this as the main website development tool but due to some errors during the testing stage, the idea of using Wix was abandoned.</p>

<p>W3Shools Spaces: W3Schools Spaces is a website that offers users to build and experiment with web-programming, and even offer website hosting. In W3SChools Spaces, they offer people to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript editors and even hosting images and audio files to the websites. Our group is using this as the main tool to write the simple HTML website for our report that will also be hosted on the group Github repository.</p>

<h1>Project Description:</h1>


<h2> Aims: </h2>

<p>Providing a world where artists and graphic designers can work on their arts and share their products in the same environment zones. A place to connect people that share the same hobby in art. </p>

<p> In order to achieve our aim, we divide it into three crucial goals: </p>

<p>+ Mobility: The application can be accessed through the internet, they can access it anywhere they want while their data is being saved in the system and they still can continue their work even though they did not borrow their personal laptop or PC. And also to solve the problem where people have to do their art works on a separate application and then have to publish it in another platform which would naturally, errors is something to be expected and times.</p>

<p>+ Quality Education Site: Where everyone can receive education from experts within the majors through their experiences and knowledge within the field and we also want to provide them with a tutorial course which contains all the material including (written information and tutorial videos) we believe could help learners have a solid structure on becoming a promising artist and designer.</p>

<p>+ Development through users opinion: We will listen to our customers' feedback, judging which of those suggestions should be prioritised  for the improvement and elevating the platform into something better through times to satisfy the requirement of customers. We will conduct a routine check twice a month of our software in order to test out new accessibilities which could be used as a stepping stone for future projects.</p>

<p> In the worst case scenario when the project does not turn out the way we want, our group also planned to omit some of the more complicated parts of our website such as the marketplace and the community forum. Instead, the interface will be made more simplified and streamlined for faster loading and the HTML-5, Javascript and WebGL file sizes of the pages would be lighter to host online.These will also reduce error probability from heavy website assets. However, the core parts of our website such as the user accounts and registration database, the repository for user-made 3D asset files and the WebGL-based 3D interactive viewer to view these files are still essential for the purposes and goal of the project. For customers/users of the site wanting to communicate with us, the support centre page will still be retained, however it will be made of form-filling bars that will be sent directly to our emails whenever a customer types their questions out and clicks the “Send” button. 
</p>

<p> As for how we intent to gain money for our website in this kind of situation, because the website had free to download and upload 3D files, the site will instead rely on embedded advertisements and there will also be a donation page that listed the recipient Paypal accounts of the web-developers (us) to help continue hosting the page on the registered domain. These money will help us to address the feedback and reports of the customers of our page about potential errors and bugs related to accessing the website and its functions.
</p>

<h2> Plan & Progress: </h2>

<h3> Plan: </h3>

<p> After 2 days discussion, we summarise all of the ideas together and we convert them into an overview routine of how can we carry out the project; therefore we summarise it into 4 parts: </p>

<p> At the beginning we divide our groups into two different teams, one assigned with seeking and analysing materials related to the needs of areas that they found are still lacking or have never being existed before, others will design out the UX and UI sample or templates for the universal website structure the general views of how our software should look and it's mechanism when we are going to establish one. </p>

<p> Next, we call it “the first bricks”, this stage consists of conducting basic structure of our website based on the resources that we gathered to write down the basic structure of our land page, consisting of multiple action panels including home icon, sections, many more and a collapsible menu. During this period, we design the general page layout for our website so it is easy to understand from the user's perspective once they accessed the website, we place out every element in an order that we found that not only is spectacular but also to prevent unwanted accident interactions. For the head of our website, we place welcoming text and the action panels are below it for the head section; we fraticate 1 of them as a home icon, 4 consoles which contains the most searched categories in the website and a button to displaying all the tags for variety of assets, all of them (including home icon) representing the connection command with text on each of those buttons to express its purpose of performing something in the designed order. While the collapsible menu, we put it on the left side of the page, where we build it in the shape of a row rectangular, its length covered from under the home icon button to the rest of the page, its contains consoles that served for the purpose of a way to activate the command where it bring user to different sub pages within the platform. In order to not make those consoles look so simple, we made a modern style for each of them which recreates those common buttons into something more lively and it looks way smoother than when using their default form.</p>

<p> Then, going deeper, after we completed the general concepts for our main page of the website, we focused on how to customise and construct our sub pages in our application; each of them are assigned with different purposes. There are 5 of them in total, named as Design & Analytics Studio, Marketing & Trading, Events, Forum, Support. For the Design & Analytics Studio page, users will have a default toolbar for editing and modelling their product making by our developers, it including  an option button to choose a variety of tools that existed in others designing applications before, another one is to upload or export their files and continue work on it, while it being saved there automatically overtime and become a draft, which mean there is no need to worry about have to clicking save button for times and also to prevent any data loss due to unexpected incidents that could waste all of their efforts and also they can extract that file anywhere just by log in their account and go to the page. Furthermore, we have an AI chatbot terminal where it can give out sample templates or give suggestions when people ask them on the way of creating a new model, based on their text or their example models. Moving on to the Marketing & Trading page, in here every product will displayed and they can be inspected by anyone, also there will be a filter button to show out every context tags and a search bar within this page, this is to return the result quicker and easier for the customers to find out notable material they looking for, we also allow a temporary chat that allows selected individuals to exchange information about the agreement and adjust it until they pleased with the conditions. The Events page, where we or company host out every activities for both competition or for the recruitment progress, it will be displayed in the centre of the page, it will be representative as a column with name, by entering one of them, it will gives out every details about the activity that was being selected by them. Event hosts can adjust the difficulty level of their tasks and the reward, in order to ensure that there is no fraud or any complaints about the dishonesty of the event administration team, clients will have to ask or send us a notification about their plans on conducting the events, after some discussion, we will clarifying whether the plan would be approved or not, after it got accepted, we will send to the client a support team in order they need help in something related to our application and also to do the administration team, for instance when a person violated the Code of Conduct in our website, there will be punishment given to them by the admin. Forum is where everyone can discuss with each other about a topic created by anyone, every member is allowed to express their perspective, but they need to make sure that it does not cross  the line. In this page, there will be 2 action panels, one for creating a thread where people place their statements about the topic they want to discuss with others users can upload images in here too, in order to present their ideas more directly. Last but not least, the Support page, as its name mentioned the real purpose of the page, is where people can ask questions, send their feedback or any other issues regarding our application; depending on the statements, we will solve the problems that our users are having or support them as soon as we can. This is where we can gather users' experiences in our application by tracking their activities including their advice on how we can improve them. </p>

<p> Finally, we will work on how to connect those together without causing a bug within the system when it is operating and conduct testing full scale on our application to make sure that we did not miss some elements in our website, change a little bit of our website design if it is necessary and test out every accessibilities. Therefore, we will run every scenario to find out whether there is an error in our platform function when we run them before deploying our product. </p>

<h3> Progress: </h3>

<p> During the discussion and designation phase, we have a little bit of struggle in finding an interesting topic that we can work on with our current skills set. It is until Bao gives his opinion about using some elements from our group's previous idea and based on it to create an improved alternative product, we then agree to follow his advice after some more discussion about whether it could fit and what it could bring to or help people in the field. </p>

<p> On one hand, we found that we did well in gathering resources and in designing UX and UI samples for our platform, the progress has gone quite smoothly to be fair, we did have a bit of issues but our team members did lend a hand whenever someone need assistance on doing their tasks or giving their suggestions in things. Despite the fact that it took us almost a week, we believe that the time we have to spend is worth all of our efforts and time, because not only we find all the necessary data, we also gain more knowledge that would benefit us later on the developing protocol. </p>

<p> On the other hand, we found that we still lack experience in utilising those information, commands and structures of programming languages used for coding our product which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is because most of us have not taken web programming courses yet or have not learned much about them despite having received some basic instruction from our lecturer recently, that is not enough for us to be too creative in applying them and likely to use pretty much references to solving our confusion or issues. </p>

<p> As for our developing stages, we are struggling on using third parties to create our platform, Wix because of the complicated mechanism of their tools, function and limitations, we then have to redevelop it with VS Code, W3Schools and Figma tool. We still manage to complete the landing page of our platform and are still working on sub pages. The reason is that when we try to convert it into HTML and then check it through VS Code, we find that the assets are misplaced, even after configuring it for 3 days, the outcome does not come like what we expected. Therefore, after 3 days of hard work but not really overcoming obstacles, we approached it in a new way; which was redeveloping our program with VS Code, W3Schools and Figma. On the contrary, although the redevelopment will also mean that the time to finish the project will be extended, we are still satisfied when we use other programming platforms, there are less limitations and restrictions when coding there, which also means we can customise the website to be more spectacular in the eyes of users and there will number of interaction increased which will attract many other people and somewhat clients. Therefore, helping us a lot in dealing with the profit and fees problem in the maintenance and management stage. </p>

<p> Overall, the plan of developing a functional website did eventually come to some promising results. We did have a functional website. This includes a functional and collapsible menu, several subpages, and a proper search function. The idea of a 3D viewer however was a bit difficult to tackle so we actually have to come up with the approach of using a pre-made WebGL-based 3D viewer as the template. However, because we also don’t have enough time, we have only tested the pre-made 3D viewer on Github before we incorporate it to our website. The 3D viewer did work, although it wasn’t as good at rendering multiple materials as we would have wanted. </p>

<h2> Roles: </h2>

<h2> Tools and technologies: </h2>

<p>Since this is a website application that displays 3D models, web programming languages make up the majority of the technologies required for this project. The language for document and content that can be used to show material and structure of web content is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Furthermore, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language for style sheets that is mostly used for extensive formatting in web design, much like the skin of HTML content. However, the backend is mostly in charge of handling the data on the homepage, such as 3D model files.</p> 

<p>Therefore Java must also be used on the backend to organize files, develop a search engine, and create a feature that allows users to filter items for better user experiences in order to handle the files that users can upload and see. Additionally, Polymage is utilized for both 2D and 3D presentations because this website differs from the majority of other websites. Thus, we want an advanced application called WebGL, a JavaScript API that can be used to render both 2D and 3D models. In addition to allowing users to examine models, WebGL also enables direct interaction with 3D models.</p>

<p>Figma Collaborative Interface Design Tool is another tool we used to create the mockup of our webpages, the reason for this is because we are developing a website with interactive elements and design so using this as our mockup would help us a lot in visualising the overall layout and functions. Because Figma also allows multiple people to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products, our group also uses it to help with the planning stage and visualise the progress of our project, as well as making contributions and feedback faster.</p>

<h2>Scope and limits:</h2>

<p> The goal of our project is to develop a novel website concept that has the potential to advance 3D models or in future will be virtual reality  more broadly. For this reason, our website offers an environment for users who are passionate about 3D model rendering, allowing them to share their creations with a community that is encouraging. Additionally, this website functions as a marketplace for 3D designers, providing them with a means of making a little money to support their pastime and foster the development of a passionate community. However, completing this project needed extensive understanding of website creation, and as we are still in the early stages of our studies, this website has several restrictions. The idea of online interactive 3D models requires specialized tools, additional WebGL implementation knowledge, and proficiency with Java in order to manage the user file database. </p>

<h2> Testing: </h2>

<h2> Timeframe: </h2>

<h2> Risks: </h2>

<p> 1. Learning Curve: If our project involves using new software or technology, there's a risk that it may have a steeper learning curve than anticipated. </p>

<p> 2. Tool Limitations: The chosen software or hardware may not have all the features or capabilities promised, leading to potential setbacks. </p>

<p> 3. Glitches/Bugs: Unexpected technical issues or bugs might arise during development, causing delays. </p>

<p> 4. Resource Constraints: Insufficient access to required resources, such as software licences or hardware components, could hinder progress. </p>

<p> 5. Dependency on External Factors: If our project relies on external APIs, libraries, or services, there's a risk of changes in those external factors affecting your project. </p>

<p> 6. Team Collaboration Issues: Conflicts or communication breakdowns within the team could impact productivity. </p>

<p> 7. Cyberattack: Unwanted assaults could cause major setbacks. </p>

<h2> Group processes and communications: </h2>

<h2> Skills and jobs: </h2>

<h1> Group Reflections: </h1>

<h2> Bảo's Reflection: </h2>

<p> From my own perspective, as a whole, the group efforts are cooperative, and we often have meetings on a weekly basis for everyone to discuss and solve the problems we encountered in our project to the best of our abilities. Everyone fulfilled their part and helped each other out. Also while the project did not turn out the way we wanted, I'm very happy to see that my teammates are helpful at providing me advice and assistance on some of the more difficult parts that our project went through. 
Because our group set the goals for the project too high, the end result definitely fell short of what we intended as we lacked the skill set and experience that could suit with what the project need, nevertheless, the most helpful advice I can draw from this is that I should set my project goal next time to be more realistic and also suitable with my current skill set. 
One thing I find surprising about the project of our group is the complexity of web programming, aside the baseline HTML, there are also the more advanced CSS, JavaScript, HTML-5 and of course, WebGL which was required to run the 3D interactive viewer online for our intended website project. The file sizes of such a webpage would be quite heavy to run because of the graphics rendering as well as various functions to manipulate the 3D object and lighting in that viewer.
Lastly, through my experience with this group, I learned how crucial effective communication is for collaborative teamwork, and also how I should tone down my expectations in group work as everyone has their own skills and personality traits that have effect on the final results of the project, and to simply do my best in faces of the worst possible outcomes in it. </p>

<h2> Quan's reflection: </h2>

<p> From my experience, as the past nearly 2 months approached, everyone as a group was very supportive and showed their commitment during the project. We often gather once or twice a weekend to exchange thoughts on our project ideas and to collaborate together to solve challenges to get the best possible outcome. Our team's original and incredible inventive ideas for the 3D model were generated throughout the project ideation phase. Furthermore, finding someone who shared my interest in modelling and game development in general was also really exciting. The fact that our group's project is a website allowed me to actively learn some web programming, which improved my ability to work with others in a team and see the value of cooperation. However, it was challenging to complete this project as planned because I still lack a lot of expertise and skills in programming. As a result, there are still certain areas that require improvement, most important among them being the WebGL concept, about which I know very little about practical applications. In summary, I would say that working in a team that is encouraging and where everyone is trying their hardest to contribute to the project as much as they can is exciting for me overall. </p>
