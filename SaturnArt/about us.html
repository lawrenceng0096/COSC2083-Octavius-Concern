            Our project, SaturnArt is intended to be a public website and a mobile app that act as a repository for 3D artists, animators and other visitors to view, sell and buy, upload and download 3D models. The idea for Polymage is that it is an online platform for creative and artistic individuals to be able to exchange ideas and download 3D assets the way they want that can be used for simulations,  animated films or video games. The site will also feature a market for selling user-made 3D assets, a community portal and forums for creators (animators and artists) with accounts to provide feedback for the platform, share their works and even get to have their works be featured on the front page of the site.
