        <p> Le Huy Hoang, student ID: s4026730, he is experiencing his first semester of Bachelor of Information Technology in RMIT Vietnam, South Saigon Campus. He is a personnel who likes to try out new things, he is always curious about how thing function and conducting studies about it to think about what can it benefits for him in future, what kind of experience can he gains from it and the way of him making a different product out by alternate those ideas to form up a different protocol to dealt with unsimilar categories. After studying for a few months in the School of Science, Engineering, Technology from RMIT, he realises that he still has a long way to go and he finds that there are many interesting things for him to discover during his study time here. Furthermore, he has more hobbies and overcomes shyness than in the past; now he likes to do group outside activities more after entering the school. His wish is to become an IT specialist in Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare. </p>

        <p> Nguyen Luong Le Bao, student ID: s3636073, is a 3rd year Bachelor of Language Major student at RMIT Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City. He is a sci-fi and fantasy book reader and enjoys watching similar movies and TV series as well as playing various types of simulated and strategy games. Most of the reasons he got interested in IT actually had to do with his interests in game developments, game designs and simulation technologies. For example the stages of game programming, in-game AI developments, procedurally generated environments as well as various applications regarding simulations of environments and objects and how they can be applied to real-life scenarios. He is currently practising web designs and web programming with CSS, Javascript and HTML5 and 3D modelling and animation as his pastimes hobbies as well to share the stuff of his creative concepts. He is probably gonna pursue future careers in the game design and development field or in animation that is related to VR technologies and the applications of AI in simulations and video games. </p>

        <p> Do Le Minh Quan, student ID: s4032589, during his free time he usually spends time listening to music and playing video games for entertainment. His passion for technology started when he was in secondary school, which he loves deep-diving into how a computerâ€™s components communicate with each other and create a useful working device. His program developer passion started when he entered high school where he was introduced to Python by his classmate and tried to do some simple projects.  He is currently studying for an Information Technology Bachelor at RMIT with various languages mostly focused on web programming, for instance, Java was used for API or website backend where manage files or features. Furthermore, for website frontend he started to learn web languages like HTML, CSS. Although he still lacks a lot of knowledge about coding so currently, he tries to learn basic HTML and CSS for web design and most importantly is Java with an extensive concept for API like JDBC which is a connection between java and database from SQl or Javalin. </p>

        <p> Tram Anh Tuan, student ID is s4075376. He is currently studying at RMIT Vietnam as an information technology major. In his leisure time, he enjoys going to the gym and reading different book genres. Which helps him have an open mind about the world and improve and sustain his physical and mental health. He is also a part of the football club at RMIT. As playing many sports, he can communicate with other teammates easily on different topics. Since he can quickly get on with other teammates and understand each person's problems when working together, the team can cooperate more effectively to find solutions when handling the group project. Furthermore, a passion for exploring and fixing computer components and solving problems are the main reasons that keep him following the path of a Technical Engineer. Finally, he is currently self-studying Python and C++ to broaden his knowledge of programming languages and also upgrade his skills to work on his private project. </p>
